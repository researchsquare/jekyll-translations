# Jekyll::Translations

This is a Jekyll plugin to manage translations from a variety of sources, including AWS S3 and PO Editor.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-translations'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-translations

## Usage

If added correctly to the Gemfile, this plugin should work as a seamless replacement to local versions of the plugin that we have been using on our frontend Jekyll sites.
